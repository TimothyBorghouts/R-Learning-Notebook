# R Learning Notebook

Welcome to my **R Learning Notebook** repository! This is where I document my progress as I explore R, from the basics like variables to more advanced data analysis with real-world datasets.

## About Me

Hi, I'm Timothy Borghouts, a 20-year-old student from Breda, Netherlands, currently studying at Avans University of Applied Sciences. While my university studies have mainly focused on Python and other programming languages like Java, JavaScript, and C#, I've developed a strong interest in learning R. This repository is dedicated to tracking my learning process and sharing what I discover along the way.

## Learning Goals

-   Variables and data types
-   Working with data frames
-   Data visualization with ggplot2
-   Statistical analysis and modeling

## Project Status

This project is in the beginning stages, and I am actively working on it. As I progress through learning R, I will continue to update this repository with new cheatsheets, exercises and more.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to explore, clone, or contribute if you'd like to share anything. This repository contains various documents and code examples that I create as I learn R. Youâ€™ll find:

-   **R Markdown (.Rmd)**
-   **.R Scripts**

### Setup Instructions:

1.  Fork and clone this repository to follow along with my learning journey.
2.  Install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) and [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).
3.  Install the necessary R packages by running the following in the R console:

\`\`\`r install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyr", "knitr", "rmarkdown"))
